# DOCSbit Cypress E2E Tests Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the DOCSbit Cypress Test Repository. This document outlines a collection of superficial, user experience-driven end-to-end tests developed for the DOCSbit web application using the Cypress testing framework. The focus is on simulating straightforward, real user interactions to ensure basic functionality and performance across different scenarios.

## Environment configuration

To run tests on a new computer, you must configure the environment. This process includes the following steps:

### Entrance requirements

### Node.js

Before you start working with the repository, make sure that Node.js is installed on your computer. Node.js is essential for managing project dependencies and running Cypress tests.

If you don't have Node.js, you can download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Git

Git is used to clone a repository from GitHub. If you don't have Git on your computer, you can install it by following the instructions below:

1. **Download Git**  
   Go to [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Git installation**  
   Open the downloaded installation file and follow the installation instructions. During installation, it is recommended to select the option that adds Git to the PATH environment variable.

3. **Checking the installation**  
   Once the installation is complete, open a terminal (CMD or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux) and type the following command to verify that Git has been installed correctly:

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

You should see the version of Git installed, confirming that it is ready to use.

### Installation and configuration of the project

1. **Cloning the Repository**: Clone the repository using the command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dz0mmm/test-2.git
   ```

2. **Installing dependencies**: Go to the repository directory and execute the command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   this command will install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Running Tests**: You can run the tests using the command:

   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

   for interactive user interface or

   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

   for headless type. The above two commands are also added to the `package.json` file and defined as**npm run test:open:gui** and **npm run test:all**.

### Available scripts

There are several scripts defined in the `package.json` file that allow you to easily run Cypress tests:

Launches Cypress in GUI mode, allowing you to interactively select and track tests:

```bash
npm run test:open:gui
```

Test results. After selecting a test, you will be taken to the results screen where each test case is visualized and you can observe the progress and results of the tests.

Runs all Cypress tests available in the project in headless mode on popular browsers:

```bash
npm run test:all:browsers
```

Above is a final summary of all run specifications (Run Finished), with a list of individual tests and their execution time.

Runs all responsiveness tests for various mobile devices (mobileResponsiveTests)

```bash
npm run test:mobileResponsive
```

Runs all basic tests for the project's homepage (homePage):

```bash
npm run test:homePage:all
```

Runs all tests for the (subPages) section:

```bash
npm run test:subPages:all
```

```bash
npm run test:subPages:features
```

Runs functionality tests for a subpage (kwowledgebase) in the (subPages) section:

```bash
npm run test:subPPages:knowledge
```
